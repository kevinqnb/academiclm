The Rittgarten kettle hole (hereafter Rittgarten) was chosen as case study for this work. Rittgarten (E013°, 42 ′ , 09 ″ , N 53°, 23 ′ , 22 ″ ) is located in Uckermark, Northeast Germany, and is a representative system of small shallow shore over /uniFB02 owkettle holes with semi-permanent hydroperiod, which abound in the region (Fig. 1).

The samples were gathered in Samambaia Lake (16¡35 ′ S, 49¡16 ′ W), which is a 33 years old pond, with an area of ca. 4 ha. Approximately, 10% of this area is covered by submerged aquatic plants (mainly Lindernia sp.). The average depth is about 3 m, with a maximum depth of 4.5 m. Since this pond is located inside the campus of the Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil), it is relatively protected from sewage drains and other impacts (BRANDÃO and KRAVCHENKO, 1997). Total P, nitrate  and  nitrate  concentrations  ranged  from  1  to  160 µ g/L,  0.99  to  710 µ g/L and 9 to 100.5 µ g/L, respectively, with median concentrations of 33 µ g/L, 83.9 µ g/L and 44.2 µ g/L (NOGUEIRA, 1999).

## Study Site and Sample Collection


Ten-liter water samples were collected in October 2016, November 2016, and December 2016 from a temperate freshwater agricultural pond in central Maryland, United States (maximum depth of ca. 3.35 meters and a surface area of ca. 0.26 ha). A Honda WX10TA (32 GPM) water pump was used to collect water 15-30 cm below the surface into a sterile polypropylene carboy. Samples were kept in the dark at 4 GLYPH<14> C and processed within 24 h of collection. In addition, a ProDSS digital sampling system (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, United States) was used to measure, in triplicate: the water temperature ( GLYPH<14> C), conductivity (SPC uS/cm), pH, dissolved oxygen (%), oxidation/reduction potential (mV), turbidity (FNU), nitrate (mg/L), and chloride (mg/L).",temperate freshwater agricultural pond,October 2016,"central Maryland, United States",pond,surface_area,0.26 ha,103.25839233398438,4.58650016784668,ha,valid

This parkland is daily used as a recreational area and frequently is cleaned by the customary collection of garbage and lawn cutting. Four man-made permanent freshwater habitats were selected for the present study. These habitats were classified as ponds according to the following definitions: (a) water bodies between 1 m 2 and 2 ha in area, which may be permanent or seasonal, including both man-made and natural water bodies (Biggs et al 2005) and (b) a water body with a maximum depth of no more than 8 m, offering water plants the possibility to colonise almost the entire area of the pond (Oertli et al 2000). The main characteristics of the four studied ponds are summarised in Table 1. Water chemical values recorded on January 2004 were provided by the city authorities. These urban ponds are eutrophic, with differences on their chemical variables. P1, usually shadowing, showed the highest conductivity, chlorides, hardness and the lowest value of dissolved oxygen. Conversely, P4 was the most oxygenated may be due to the great photosynthetic activity, with the highest value of pH, total phosphorus and ammonium. In these ponds, no free-floating plant was observed and the removal of submerged vegetation by the park authorities was observed on each sample date. The surface water temperature of each water body was measured on every sample date with a digital thermometer. The surface areas of water bodies were calculated from aerial photographs provided by the Instituto Geográfico Militar (1998; scale 1:15,000) using GIS-Arc View 3.1.",Ponds,,Parques de Palermo,pond,surface_area,2,42.36995315551758,1.8778283596038816,ha,mis-interpretation

Japanese White-eye ( Zosterops japonica ), Red Turtle Dove ( Streptopelia tranquebarica ), Oriental Turtle Dove ( S . orientalis ), and Barn Swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) were mainly distributed in cells with large areas and high concentrations of phytoplankton Chl -a and SS and pH values (Fig. 4). Cattle Egret ( Bubulcus ibis ), Common Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ), Yellow-bellied Prinia ( Prinia flaviventris ), Tawny Prinia ( P . subflava ), and Spotted-necked Dove ( Streptopelia chinensis ) were positively correlated with the density of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Fig. 4).



The RDA with automatic forward selection showed that the fish community structure in the constructed wetlands was significantly correlated with the wetland area, H ′ of aquatic macrophytes, concentrations of DO, SS, TP, and COD, and density of aquatic macroinvertebrates ( p < 0.1, Monte Carlo permutation with 999 permutations; Table 7). Seven variables explained 46.4% of the total variation in abundances of four dominant fish species ( F = 5.57, df = 6 and 44, p = 0.0010, Monte Carlo permutation test with 999 permutations; Table 8). The RDA plot showed that goldfish, tilapia,



and topmouth gudgeon were more abundant in treatment cells with a larger area, higher concentrations of SS and COD, and a low density of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Fig. 5).

Vegetation harvesting from the shoreline zones and floating island


In 2015, we identified 3714 plants in the three vegetated shorelines planted at LA and B17 in 2013, and at MA in 2014. The autumn harvesting of vegetation from the shoreline vegetation zones removed over 2.5 kg of nitrogen and almost 0.5 kg of phosphorous (Table 1). Approximately 1000 plants were planted on the floating island, an area of 100 m 2 , which was constructed in LA in 2013. In all, 0.38 kg of N and 0.06 kg of P was estimated to have been removed from the floating island. The cost of construction and maintenance of the shoreline vegetation was €11250 from a 10-year perspective and is estimating to €15250 from a 20-year perspective (Table 1).




 
## 3.3.4. Hydrodictyon reticulatum removal


In 2014, H. reticulatum was removed from 450 m 2 and 1530 m 2 areas in LA and MA, respectively. The removal of H. reticulatum from LA and MA eliminated 18.5 g and 1.18 g of nitrogen and phosphorous, respectively, for each kilogram of dry biomass of these green algae (Table 5). In total, by removing 59.4 m 3 of algae, 11.6 kg of nitrogen and 0.74 kg of phosphorous were extracted from the reservoirs (Table 1). The cost of the one-time removal of H. reticulatum was €764.

Removal of nutrients with sediment


Before restoration efforts, the bottom sediments from the Arturówek reservoirs were removed in 2000 by the Łódź City Government. The sediment thickness in UA in 2013, when it was dredged again, reached up to 40 cm and 3548 m 3 . In total, 9795 m 3 of bottom sediment was dredged from three reservoirs and B17 pond. The recommended period before the next dredging would be 10 years for this case. But we estimate that limiting the inflow of pollutants through the construction of SSBS and hybrid systems and other activities will extend this time to 20 years.



A literature review shows that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous in bottom sediment is highly variable. In the Arturówek reservoirs, the amounts ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 g for TN and from 19.2 to 29.5 mg for TP per each kilogram of dry weight (Table 5). Studies conducted by Waajen et al. (2014) on three reservoirs, Dongen Pond (2500 m 2 ), Eindhoven Pond (6500 m 2 ) and Heesch Pond (1600 m 2 ) in the Netherlands, indicated that sediment contained 0.26 mg, 0.43 mg and 0.11 mg of phosphorous in one gram of dry weight, respectively. These values were 10 times higher than those of the sediment removed from the Arturówek reservoirs (0.024 mg P g -1 dry weight) and almost equivalent to those of sediment removed from the separators (0.435 mg P g -1 dry weight).

Before restoration efforts, the bottom sediments from the Arturówek reservoirs were removed in 2000 by the Łódź City Government.

Removal of nutrients with vegetation


Planting and subsequent harvesting of vegetation is often used for water quality protection (Verhofstad et al., 2017). In our work, the efficiency and costs differed for different vegetation types (Iamchaturapatr et al., 2007, Kumwimba et al., 2017).



The construction of a 100 m 2 floating island was a very expensive investment and, in our study, the cost was very high compared to the efficiency. Nevertheless, several studies show that in locations where other measures are impossible to install, a floating island seems to be a well-functioning tool. Lynch et al. (2015) showed reductions of 40% of the initial nitrogen and 48% of the initial phosphorus concentrations in a mesocosm experiment. McAndrew et al. (2016) showed that a 50 m 2 floating island, constructed in the stormwater Mason Pond (area of 7100 m 2 ) in Virginia, effectively removed 191 g of nitrogen from the pond. In an experiment in North Carolina on two retention ponds (areas of 0.36 ha and 0.05 ha), Winston et al. (2013) constructed 12 and 4 floating islands, respectively, with an area of 23 m 2 each, which reduced TN and TP concentrations by 36-59% and 36-57%, respectively.



The cost of construction and maintenance of shoreline vegetation was comparatively low from a 10-year perspective and only increased insignificantly over the next 10 years. However, considering the amount of N and P removed, the harvesting of the shoreline vegetation zone was not a very efficient measure. Still, we assume that the cost efficiency of the shoreline vegetation will improve over time with increasing biomass, yield and, consequently, N and P assimilation (Gachango et al., 2015, Kumwimba et al., 2017). The shoreline vegetation also had other ecological functions, such as providing habitat for zooplankton and reservoir fauna (Chesnes et al., 2011, Herrmann, 2012).",Mason Pond,,Virginia,pond,surface_area,7100,62.927764892578125,2.8262338638305664,m^2,valid

## 2.1. Study Area


The samples were gathered in Samambaia Lake (16¡35 ′ S, 49¡16 ′ W), which is a 33 years old pond, with an area of ca. 4 ha. Approximately, 10% of this area is covered by submerged aquatic plants (mainly Lindernia sp.). The average depth is about 3 m, with a maximum depth of 4.5 m. Since this pond is located inside the campus of the Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil), it is relatively protected from sewage drains and other impacts (BRANDÃO and KRAVCHENKO, 1997). Total P, nitrate  and  nitrate  concentrations  ranged  from  1  to  160 µ g/L,  0.99  to  710 µ g/L and 9 to 100.5 µ g/L, respectively, with median concentrations of 33 µ g/L, 83.9 µ g/L and 44.2 µ g/L (NOGUEIRA, 1999).




 
## 2.2. Sampling


Samples were gathered on August 2003 (dry period) and January 2004 (rainy period), on nine sites distributed along the major axis of the pond (Fig. 1). On each site, 1000 L of water were filtered over a 70 µ m zooplankton net, using a suction pump. Samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and concentrated to a standard volume of 500 mL.



Testate  amoebae,  microcrustaceans  and  rotifers  were  counted  in  a  Sedgwick-Rafter  counting  cell using a stereomicroscope and were expressed as individuals per liter.

The Rittgarten kettle hole (hereafter Rittgarten) was chosen as case study for this work. Rittgarten (E013°, 42 ′ , 09 ″ , N 53°, 23 ′ , 22 ″ ) is located in Uckermark, Northeast Germany, and is a representative system of small shallow shore over /uniFB02 owkettle holes with semi-permanent hydroperiod, which abound in the region (Fig. 1). According to the hydrogeomorphic classi /uniFB01 cation developed by Kalettka and Rudat (2006), these type of kettle holes only dry up every few years after a persistent precipitation de /uniFB01 cit. Rittgarten (Fig. 1) has been intensively studied as part of the long-term studies of the LandScales project (Premke et al., 2016; Nitzsche et al. 2017). Its topographic catchment ( ≈ 5.7 ha) is dominated by intensive agriculture, and is characterized by a low to medium erosion exposure (Kleeberg et al., 2016a). When it is completely inundated, maximal water depth is about 2.3 m at the deepest point, while the surrounding area is around 1460 m 2 . Rittgarten is dominated by edge type vegetation (Luthardt and Dreger, 1996); namely, a reed belt of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin ex Steudel (Kleeberg et al., 2016a). Rittgarten is hydraulically connected to a shallow aquifer with a thick till layer as lower con /uniFB01 ningbed. The sediments consist of medium to coarse grained glacial sand alternating with silty-loamy layers of various thickness and



lenses of weathered till (Merz and Steidl, 2015).

48 ponds from the Brussels Capital Region (Belgium) were studied between 2003 and 2009. All the ponds are located within a radius of 10 km. They are all shallow (maximum depth \ 3 m; mean depth around



1 m; Table 1), flat-bottomed and range in surface area from 0.1 to 6 ha. A number of ponds are used for different recreational activities of which fishing and boating are the most common. The ponds are populated by fish communities typical of northern Europe. Many of them harbour large stocks of plankti-benthivorous fish (mainly common carp: Cyprinus carpio , and bream: Abramis brama ).



During the study period, the ponds were sampled mostly during the warm season (May-September on 6 to 27 occasions per pond) for phytoplankton, zooplankton, main nutrients and submerged vegetation. They were sampled monthly or at least on three occasions per warm season.



One integrated water column sample of 10 l based on 10 random sub-samples of 1 l was taken from each pond with a plastic tube sampler. A special extension was fixed to the sampler to reach the deeper parts of the ponds when appropriate. Secchi depth (SD) was measured with a Secchi disc of 30 cm diameter. When the SD was greater than the depth of the pond, depending on whether the disc was well or poorly visible, 1 or 0.1 m was added to the depth value, respectively.",ponds,2003-2009,Brussels Capital Region (Belgium),pond,max_depth,10,58.66138458251953,2.779752492904663,m,mis-interpretation
classification trees as a tool for predicting cyanobacterial blooms,peretyatko; anatoly; teissier; samuel; de backer; sylvia; triest; ludwig,2011,405,"These results suggest, however, that low nitrogen concentrations favour not only heterocystous cyanobacteria, but vacuolated cyanobacteria in general, for the blooms that occurred below the DIN thresholds were often dominated by non-heterocystous cyanobacteria, mainly Planktothrix spp., and Microcystis spp. This is consistent with the findings of Ferber et al. (2004) who suggested that both non-heterocystous and heterocystous vacuolated cyanobacteria can outcompete eukaryotic phytoplankters owing to their ability to regulate their position in the watercolumn that allows them reaching nutrients released by the sediment. The strong migratory abilities of the vacuolated cyanobacterial genera that dominated cyanobacterial blooms as well as their preference for NH4 ? as a nutrient source are well documented (Hyenstrand et al., 1998; Ferber et al., 2004; Reynolds, 2006). This is consistent with the low depth of the ponds studied (around 1 m on average) and high rates of ammonium release from the sediment (mean = 75.8 ± 92.8 (sd) mg NH4 ? -N/ m 2 /day; n = 98; pond number = 22; unpublished data). Thus, reaching abundant benthic ammonium and bringing it stored to the surface for photosynthesis can give cyanobacteria a strong competitive advantage over eukaryotic phytoplankters unable to regulate their position in the water column. It should be noted that because of very low depth, the ponds studied are often well mixed, which implies that mixing can considerably reduce this advantage of cyanobacteria by facilitating access of eukaryotic phytoplankters to benthic nitrogen. Shifts in the phytoplankton assemblages towards flagellated eukaryotes, whose motility is mostly superior to that of cyanobacteria (Reynolds, 2006), also reduce the competitive advantages of cyanobacteria. These are probably the reasons why DIN concentrations showed limited predictive capacity for cyanobacterial blooms.",ponds,,,pond,max_depth,1 m,56.94297790527344,2.813335657119751,m,mis-interpretation

The samples were gathered in Samambaia Lake (16¡35 ′ S, 49¡16 ′ W), which is a 33 years old pond, with an area of ca. 4 ha. Approximately, 10% of this area is covered by submerged aquatic plants (mainly Lindernia sp.). The average depth is about 3 m, with a maximum depth of 4.5 m.

On each site, 1000 L of water were filtered over a 70 µ m zooplankton net, using a suction pump. Samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and concentrated to a standard volume of 500 mL.



Testate  amoebae,  microcrustaceans  and  rotifers  were  counted  in  a  Sedgwick-Rafter  counting  cell using a stereomicroscope and were expressed as individuals per liter.



The following abiotic variables were determined with a HORIBA U - 10 water quality meter: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and water temperature. Water transparency (Secchi disk) and depth values were also recorded in all sites.",Samambaia Lake,,"Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil)",pond,max_depth,4.5 m,103.5953369140625,4.611231803894043,m,valid

sampled when sufficient water was present (a minimum water depth of 0.1 m). Sampling was carried out on foot from the edge of the water body with the exact position (recorded using GPS) changing slightly depending on the distribution of water (i.e., the water level).



On each sampling occasion (approximately every 30 d) in situ water conductivity, temperature and pH were measured and water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll ( Chl a ), nutrients, dissolved organic matter, oxygen, pH and total alkalinity ( AT ).

Veta la Palma had the second largest water coverage and changed relatively little throughout the study period (ranging between 14 and 37 km 2 ). Variation in water cover in the dune ponds was more seasonal (0.1 to 4 km 2 ), with the highest cover observed in the wet season. Because of the small size of these water bodies i.e., problems reliably detecting them with the satellite sensors used, these are probably underestimations.

concordance of species composition patterns among microcrustaceans; rotifers and testate amoebae in a shallow pond,bini et al.,2007,490,"## 2. Methods



 
## 2.1. Study Area


The samples were gathered in Samambaia Lake (16¡35 ′ S, 49¡16 ′ W), which is a 33 years old pond, with an area of ca. 4 ha. Approximately, 10% of this area is covered by submerged aquatic plants (mainly Lindernia sp.). The average depth is about 3 m, with a maximum depth of 4.5 m. Since this pond is located inside the campus of the Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil), it is relatively protected from sewage drains and other impacts (BRANDÃO and KRAVCHENKO, 1997). Total P, nitrate  and  nitrate  concentrations  ranged  from  1  to  160 µ g/L,  0.99  to  710 µ g/L and 9 to 100.5 µ g/L, respectively, with median concentrations of 33 µ g/L, 83.9 µ g/L and 44.2 µ g/L (NOGUEIRA, 1999).




 
## 2.2. Sampling


Samples were gathered on August 2003 (dry period) and January 2004 (rainy period), on nine sites distributed along the major axis of the pond (Fig. 1). On each site, 1000 L of water were filtered over a 70 µ m zooplankton net, using a suction pump. Samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and concentrated to a standard volume of 500 mL.



Testate  amoebae,  microcrustaceans  and  rotifers  were  counted  in  a  Sedgwick-Rafter  counting  cell using a stereomicroscope and were expressed as individuals per liter.



The following abiotic variables were determined with a HORIBA U - 10 water quality meter: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and water temperature. Water transparency (Secchi disk) and depth values were also recorded in all sites.",Samambaia Lake,,"Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil)",pond,vegetation_cover,10%,55.68790817260742,2.7845170497894287,%,valid

## Study Site and Sample Collection


Ten-liter water samples were collected in October 2016, November 2016, and December 2016 from a temperate freshwater agricultural pond in central Maryland, United States (maximum depth of ca. 3.35 meters and a surface area of ca. 0.26 ha). A Honda WX10TA (32 GPM) water pump was used to collect water 15-30 cm below the surface into a sterile polypropylene carboy. Samples were kept in the dark at 4 GLYPH<14> C and processed within 24 h of collection. In addition, a ProDSS digital sampling system (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, United States) was used to measure, in triplicate: the water temperature ( GLYPH<14> C), conductivity (SPC uS/cm), pH, dissolved oxygen (%), oxidation/reduction potential (mV), turbidity (FNU), nitrate (mg/L), and chloride (mg/L).",temperate freshwater agricultural pond,October 2016,"central Maryland, United States",pond,ph,7.9,78.90445709228516,3.716820478439331,,hallucination

This parkland is daily used as a recreational area and frequently is cleaned by the customary collection of garbage and lawn cutting. Four man-made permanent freshwater habitats were selected for the present study. These habitats were classified as ponds according to the following definitions: (a) water bodies between 1 m 2 and 2 ha in area, which may be permanent or seasonal, including both man-made and natural water bodies (Biggs et al 2005) and (b) a water body with a maximum depth of no more than 8 m, offering water plants the possibility to colonise almost the entire area of the pond (Oertli et al 2000). The main characteristics of the four studied ponds are summarised in Table 1. Water chemical values recorded on January 2004 were provided by the city authorities. These urban ponds are eutrophic, with differences on their chemical variables. P1, usually shadowing, showed the highest conductivity, chlorides, hardness and the lowest value of dissolved oxygen. Conversely, P4 was the most oxygenated may be due to the great photosynthetic activity, with the highest value of pH, total phosphorus and ammonium. In these ponds, no free-floating plant was observed and the removal of submerged vegetation by the park authorities was observed on each sample date.

The RDA ordination plot indicated that narrow-winged damselflies (Coenagrionidae), giant water bugs ( Diplonychus sp.) and leaf beetle larvae (Chrysomelidae) were more abundant in treatment cells with high cover of aquatic macrophytes (Fig. 6). Apple snails ( Pomacea canaliculata ) and mayflies ( Cloeon sp.) were positively correlated with water temperature (Fig. 6). Dipteran species such as mosquitoes ( Culex spp.), brine flies (Ephydridae), and non-biting midges (Chironomidae) were more abundant in treatment cells with high values of conductivity and low values of DO (Fig. 6).",narrow-winged damselflies,,treatment cells,pond,ph,6.8,85.16934204101562,3.6320583820343018,,hallucination

classification trees as a tool for predicting cyanobacterial blooms,peretyatko; anatoly; teissier; samuel; de backer; sylvia; triest; ludwig,2011,396,"## Results


The ponds studied showed contrasting ecology spanning over a number of environmental gradients. TP



concentrations ranged from \ 50 l gP l -1 to [ 1 mgP l -1 ; DIN concentrations from below detection (1 l gN l -1 ) to [ 3 mgN l -1 ; pH from 7.1 to 9.7. Submerged vegetation cover varied from absence through sparse and patchy to dense and extensive, at times covering the whole surface of a pond (Table 1). Some ponds were fishless, whereas others harboured more than 1,000 kg ha -1 of plankti-benthivorous fish (data not shown). Because of the differences in submerged vegetation cover and fish biomass and community structure, zooplankton composition, of bloom per node and percentage of blooms accounted by node. The predictor variables and respective thresholds identified by the trees link the nodes. Dashed line outlines the optimal tree denoted by the 10-fold cross-validation procedure



densities and size were also very variable ranging from Rotifera to large-bodied Cladocera dominated communities.



Contrasting ecology was reflected on phytoplankton biomass and composition. Chl a concentrations covered the range from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic state (from \ 2 to [ 800 l g l -1 ; UNEP-IETC, 1999). The ponds with low phytoplankton biomass were generally dominated by cryptophytes, diatoms and chrysophytes, whereas the ponds with higher biomass tended towards chlorophyte, euglenophyte",ponds,,,pond,ph,7.1 to 9.7,193.8643493652344,8.261124610900879,,mis-interpretation
classification trees as a tool for predicting cyanobacterial blooms,peretyatko; anatoly; teissier; samuel; de backer; sylvia; triest; ludwig,2011,403,"Different cyanobacterial biovolume levels used in the analysis rendered comparable results in terms of the main predictors and related thresholds. SD of 0.57 m appeared on all classification trees suggesting a critical phytoplankton biomass level below which the risk of bloom occurrence rapidly increased and above which it was virtually inexistent. At higher cyanobacterial biovolume levels ( C 5 and C 10 mm 3 l -1 ) another SD threshold of about 0.4 m was identified that allowed further differentiation of the bloom risk. A pH threshold of 8.7 also appeared on all three classification trees and in combination with the SD thresholds delimited the conditions of the highest risk of bloom occurrence apparently induced by carbon limitation (Reynolds, 2006; Shapiro, 1973, 1997). A pH threshold of 8 appeared at the two lower levels of cyanobacterial biovolumes ( C 2 and C 5 mm 3 l -1 ) and delimited the conditions with a markedly lower risk of bloom occurrence, suggesting that at pH ranging between 8 and 8.7 some eukaryotic phytoplankters are still able to compete with cyanobacteria for dominance. This is supported by the fact that this threshold was not validated by the cross-validation procedure for cyanobacterial biovolume C 5 mm 3 l -1 and suggests a decrease in its predictive capacity with the increase in the magnitude of cyanobacterial blooms.



Besides phytoplankton biomass and pH, nitrogen availability seems to have played a role, although visibly less important than the former two factors, in determining cyanobacterial bloom occurrence. The DIN thresholds allow predicting relatively high percentage of cyanobacterial blooms. The probabilities related to them are higher at lower cyanobacterial biovolume level suggesting that in the ponds studied low DIN concentrations are more important for cyanobacterial bloom initiation than when a bloom is established. The established blooms were often associated with elevated concentrations of NH4 ? likely produced by the mineralisation of dead phytoplankton, suggesting that nitrogen limitation was not the main factor responsible for the maintenance of cyanobacterial dominance.",ponds,,,pond,ph,8.7,83.00015258789062,3.656580924987793,,mis-interpretation

Water quality and nutrient sources and movements



We collected water samples every 2 weeks from the 10 pools (Fig. 1) from November 2004 to October 2006. We measured depth (cm) against fixed posts and measured temperature ( /C176 C) by a YSI meter 550. Measurements of pH and conductivity ( l S cm -1 ) using a Hanna HI 9812 pH meter were also recorded in situ. For, alkalinity (mEq l -1 ) we titrated water samples against standard acid to an end point of pH 4.5 (Mackereth et al., 1989) within a few hours of collection. Total suspended solids (TSS, mg l -1 ) were also measured gravimetrically by filtering water through pre-weighed GF/C filters and then drying the filters for 24 h at 105 /C176 C. We used filtered water for chemical analysis of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP, l g l -1 ), nitrate nitrogen (NO3 --N, mg l -1 ) and ammonium nitrogen (NH4 ? -N, l g l -1 ), based on Mackereth et al. (1989). We followed methods of Johnes & Heathwaite (1992) to measure total nitrogen (TN, mg l -1 ) and total phosphorus (TP, l g l -1 ). We determined chlorophyll a after filtration through Whatman glass microfibre filters (GF/C, 47 mm) and acetone extraction using Talling & Driver (1961).



To study sources and movement of nutrients in the site, shallow soil- and groundwater flowing from land was collected by 10 tubes (lysimeters of 10 cm diameter and 1.50 m depth) installed in two lines N/S and E/W across the area of Brown Moss in January 2005 (Fig. 2). We used a barrel auger to create boreholes and then we sank each tube approximately 1.0 m into the ground, leaving 0.50 m above the ground surface. Afterwards, surrounding holes were backfilled with soil cored from the holes and the tube tops were covered with rubber stoppers to avoid contamination from outside.

Sites were sampled in late summer (2 -8 February) 2011, following two weeks of persistent heavy rain (c. 215 -235 mm across the study area), causing refilling of the CTWs after a dry spring and early summer (c. 125 -135 mm over the preceding 12 weeks) (CliFlo 2017). We acknowledge that our sampling is a snapshot of the late-austral summer zooplankton community and environmental conditions, and that greater zooplankton diversity and variety of conditions would likely be encountered if seasonal or higher frequency sampling was undertaken. Single measurements of physicochemical variables were made at each site, including wetted area, depth, connectivity with the downstream lake (high = 3, medium = 2, low = 1, no connectivity = 0), as well as water temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration (DO), specific conductivity and pH, using a YSI 6000 UPG Multi Parameter Sonde (Yellow Springs Instruments, Ohio, USA). Area of the lakes was calculated from digitised aerial images (2016), and was measured manually in the field for CTWs and drains (over the 10 m reach surveyed). Sites with ' no connectivity ' to the downstream lake occurred where the original drain outlet had been filled to create a ' filtration ' outlet for the CTW.



Water samples for measurement of nutrients, Chl a , suspended solids and zooplankton were collected concurrently from the middle of CTWs and drains from a depth of approximately 0.3 m using a 1 L measuring jug on a 2 m pole. Samples were collected from lake habitats at a similar depth, from platforms built by duck-hunters which extend out into the lake approximately 5 -10 m from the shore.

Each habitat type supported significantly different zooplankton communities (refer to results of PERMANOV A and pairwise comparisons), including between drains and CTWs. Habitat morphologies including surface area, water depth and macrophyte cover were most strongly associated with variations in zooplankton composition, whilst significant water quality parameters included pH, conductivity, iron flocculant and concentrations of PO4-P and inorganic-N. Drain habitats were smaller and shallower than CTWs, with dense macrophyte cover, high concentrations of NH4-N and NO3-N, and high frequency of iron flocculant occurrence. CTW habitats were intermediate in size between lakes and drains, relatively deep and with high Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations, indicative of elevated phytoplankton biomass. Levels of PO4-P were also highest in CTWs, particularly in those with low pH. Lakes were naturally the largest habitats and moderately deep with warmer water temperatures, high DO and neutral pH. Similar to CTW habitats, lakes had elevated Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations due to high phytoplankton densities, which in turn supported greater zooplankton abundances.



As evidenced by the results from this study, dense macrophyte cover in small, shallow watercourses suppresses phytoplankton growth and can cause stagnant, reducing conditions, elevating NH4-N levels. Nonetheless, while excessive macrophyte growth can have negative impacts on stream



communities (Collier et al. 1999), macrophytes improve the structural complexity of freshwater habitats and strongly influence community structure and diversity (Warfe and Barmuta 2006; Lucena-Moya and Duggan 2011).",lakes,,,lake,ph,7.4,81.27967834472656,3.73176908493042,,hallucination

contribution of donana wetlands to carbon sequestration,morris et al,2013,613,"## Sampling design


Samples were collected from 11 water bodies ( n =6 to 12 per water body), selected to represent the diversity of aquatic systems within the region (Fig. 1), as part of an on going monitoring program between 2009 and 2011. Permission for field sampling was given by the director (Juan Carlos Rubio Garcia) of the Don ˜ana Natural Area. Field studies did not involve endangered or protected species. Sites from Veta la Palma (M1:M4) are outside of



the National Park boundaries and close to the Guadalquivir estuary. M1 (Cuquero Grande) and M2 (Cuquero Chico) are unmanaged temporal ponds, whereas M3 (Gaveta 4) and M4 (Gaveta 1) are used for aquaculture, with water pumped in from the estuary, and hence influenced by saline waters. In 2010-2011 water levels were maintained all season in M3, but not M4. M7 is situated at the entrance of La Rocina stream into the wetlands. M8 (Laguna Dulce) is one of the larger semi-permanent oligohaline ponds situated within a large sand dune system (the Dune ponds region). M5 (La Fao) and M6 (Marisma Galega) are semipermanent ponds connected to the marshes and the other sites (M9:M11) are situated in temporal marshes, and thus only



sampled when sufficient water was present (a minimum water depth of 0.1 m). Sampling was carried out on foot from the edge of the water body with the exact position (recorded using GPS) changing slightly depending on the distribution of water (i.e., the water level).



On each sampling occasion (approximately every 30 d) in situ water conductivity, temperature and pH were measured and water samples were collected for laboratory analysis of suspended particulate matter (SPM), chlorophyll ( Chl a ), nutrients, dissolved organic matter, oxygen, pH and total alkalinity ( AT ). Sampling occurred during daylight hours and took 2 days, with the processing of water samples carried out in a field laboratory each evening.",temporal marshes,2009-2011,M9:M11,wetland,ph,6.0 8.0,196.94956970214844,8.38899040222168,,hallucination
bacterial processes and biogeochemical changes in the water body of kettle holes - mainly driven by autochthonous organic matter?,attermeyer; katrin; grossart; hans-peter; flury; sabine; premke; katrin,2017,158,"## Physico-chemical analysis


Water temperatures were lowest in February (4.1-5.8 °C), highest in June (14.1-18.8 °C) and intermediate in October



(5.4-7.8). Oxygen   (O 2 ) concentrations were lowest in early summer when some kettle holes showed suboxic to anoxic conditions  (see  Supp.  1),  but  pH  exhibited  no  clear  trend with higher or lower values throughout the sampling period (7.9  ±  1; mean  ±  standard deviation).



POM was highest, but also most variable in June ranging from 3.0 to 58.6 mg L -1 . DOC concentrations covered a huge range from 9.7 up to 42.3 mg L -1 (Fig. 1c) and varied extensively between different kettle holes and sampling dates.  From  February  to  June,  DOC  increased  in  almost all kettle holes, on average by 76%. This trend changed in October when DOC dropped back to values more similar to  February (Fig. 1c). TDN increased during the growing season from February to October and ranged between 0.7 and 7.5 mg   L -1 across all sampling dates and kettle holes (Fig. 1d). The trend differed for TDP which showed generally  higher  values  in  June  as  compared  to  October  (range from 18 to 1674 µg L -1 over all sampling dates and kettle holes; Fig. 1e). The highest variations of TDP in all kettle holes occurred in June when the highest value was measured. All measured nutrients (DOC, TDN, and TDP) were significantly  different  between  the  three  sampling  dates (Table 4) indicating a generally high temporal variability in kettle hole nutrient dynamics.

Changes in nutrient concentration


In the restored pond, the average TN concentrations before and after restoration were comparable (slightly < 2 mg L -1 ), and the differences were not statistically significant (Table 4). In the unrestored B11 pond, a systematic increase in the TN concentration has been observed every year since 2011. The concentration increased from 1.48 mg L -1 in 2011 to 4.86 mg L -1 in 2016.



The ammonium concentration in the B17 pond significantly (p < 0.001) decreased after restoration, when the average concentration declined to 50% of the values recorded from 2010 to 2012 (0.56 mg L -1 ). In the B11 pond, ammonium values significantly (p < 0.001) increased and were finally more than 20 times higher in 2016 (2.89 mg L -1 ) than in 2011 and 2012 (Table 4). Mean nitrate values were similar in the preand post-restoration periods (0.21 mg L -1 ) in the B17 pond. In the B11 pond, the nitrate concentrations recorded from 2014 to 2016 doubled in relation to the previous values but remained low (below 0.1 mg L -1 ), and the difference had no statistical significance. In 2014-2016 nitrite concentrations were slightly lower in the B17 pond and slightly higher in the B11 pond then in previously years and amounted to 0.024 mg L -1 and 0.028 mg L -1 , respectively.

Vegetation harvesting from the shoreline zones and floating island


In 2015, we identified 3714 plants in the three vegetated shorelines planted at LA and B17 in 2013, and at MA in 2014. The autumn harvesting of vegetation from the shoreline vegetation zones removed over 2.5 kg of nitrogen and almost 0.5 kg of phosphorous (Table 1). Approximately 1000 plants were planted on the floating island, an area of 100 m 2 , which was constructed in LA in 2013. In all, 0.38 kg of N and 0.06 kg of P was estimated to have been removed from the floating island. The cost of construction and maintenance of the shoreline vegetation was €11250 from a 10-year perspective and is estimating to €15250 from a 20-year perspective (Table 1).




 
## 3.3.4. Hydrodictyon reticulatum removal


In 2014, H. reticulatum was removed from 450 m 2 and 1530 m 2 areas in LA and MA, respectively. The removal of H. reticulatum from LA and MA eliminated 18.5 g and 1.18 g of nitrogen and phosphorous, respectively, for each kilogram of dry biomass of these green algae (Table 5). In total, by removing 59.4 m 3 of algae, 11.6 kg of nitrogen and 0.74 kg of phosphorous were extracted from the reservoirs (Table 1). The cost of the one-time removal of H. reticulatum was €764.

Removal of nutrients with vegetation


Planting and subsequent harvesting of vegetation is often used for water quality protection (Verhofstad et al., 2017). In our work, the efficiency and costs differed for different vegetation types (Iamchaturapatr et al., 2007, Kumwimba et al., 2017).



The construction of a 100 m 2 floating island was a very expensive investment and, in our study, the cost was very high compared to the efficiency. Nevertheless, several studies show that in locations where other measures are impossible to install, a floating island seems to be a well-functioning tool. Lynch et al. (2015) showed reductions of 40% of the initial nitrogen and 48% of the initial phosphorus concentrations in a mesocosm experiment. McAndrew et al. (2016) showed that a 50 m 2 floating island, constructed in the stormwater Mason Pond (area of 7100 m 2 ) in Virginia, effectively removed 191 g of nitrogen from the pond. In an experiment in North Carolina on two retention ponds (areas of 0.36 ha and 0.05 ha), Winston et al. (2013) constructed 12 and 4 floating islands, respectively, with an area of 23 m 2 each, which reduced TN and TP concentrations by 36-59% and 36-57%, respectively.



The cost of construction and maintenance of shoreline vegetation was comparatively low from a 10-year perspective and only increased insignificantly over the next 10 years. However, considering the amount of N and P removed, the harvesting of the shoreline vegetation zone was not a very efficient measure. Still, we assume that the cost efficiency of the shoreline vegetation will improve over time with increasing biomass, yield and, consequently, N and P assimilation (Gachango et al., 2015, Kumwimba et al., 2017). The shoreline vegetation also had other ecological functions, such as providing habitat for zooplankton and reservoir fauna (Chesnes et al., 2011, Herrmann, 2012).",Mason Pond,,Virginia,pond,tn,191,35.79558563232422,1.9328951835632324,mg/L,mis-interpretation

Japanese White-eye ( Zosterops japonica ), Red Turtle Dove ( Streptopelia tranquebarica ), Oriental Turtle Dove ( S . orientalis ), and Barn Swallow ( Hirundo rustica ) were mainly distributed in cells with large areas and high concentrations of phytoplankton Chl -a and SS and pH values (Fig. 4). Cattle Egret ( Bubulcus ibis ), Common Moorhen ( Gallinula chloropus ), Yellow-bellied Prinia ( Prinia flaviventris ), Tawny Prinia ( P . subflava ), and Spotted-necked Dove ( Streptopelia chinensis ) were positively correlated with the density of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Fig. 4).



The RDA with automatic forward selection showed that the fish community structure in the constructed wetlands was significantly correlated with the wetland area, H ′ of aquatic macrophytes, concentrations of DO, SS, TP, and COD, and density of aquatic macroinvertebrates ( p < 0.1, Monte Carlo permutation with 999 permutations; Table 7). Seven variables explained 46.4% of the total variation in abundances of four dominant fish species ( F = 5.57, df = 6 and 44, p = 0.0010, Monte Carlo permutation test with 999 permutations; Table 8). The RDA plot showed that goldfish, tilapia,



and topmouth gudgeon were more abundant in treatment cells with a larger area, higher concentrations of SS and COD, and a low density of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Fig. 5).

characterizing ponds in a watershed simulation and evaluating their influence on streamflow in a mississippi watershed,yasarer,2018,377,"## Potential impacts on geochemical and physical processes


Ponds increase the residence time of water within the upstream hydrological network, which has an influence on sediment and nutrient loads transported downstream. Small ponds are highly effective at trapping sediment, with reported rates of 50 -80% in arable landscapes (Mekonnen et al . 2014). Trapping efficiency can vary greatly between ponds, and sediment particle size will influence greatly if particles settle or are suspended



in the water column and likely to be transported downstream (Verstraeten and Poesen 2001). Field studies also have demonstrated a strong relationship between water trapping and nutrient trapping (Cooper and Knight 1990, Yin and Shan 2001, Fairchild and Velinsky 2006). Stream nutrient loads were not verified in these simulations, so estimates were not made with regard to reductions in nitrogen and phosphorus loads due to trapping in the pond. Also, as these ponds are located in the upland portions of the watershed and with very little agricultural land use, overall watershed loads of nitrogen and phosphorus are likely minimally reduced by the ponds. However, a study of Morris Pond (labeled in Fig. 5), one of the largest reservoirs within the Goodwin Creek watershed, demonstrated storm-event nutrient trapping efficiencies ranging from 54% for total phosphorus to 71% for nitratenitrogen (Cooper and Knight 1990). Ponds can be successful locations for nutrient trapping as they provide a space for the physical capture of dissolved and particulate sources of nutrients. Ponds also increase the residence time for nutrients, which encourages biological and chemical processing through uptake, denitrification, and sediment sorption (Wetzel 2001).



The ponds also showed that they immediately reduced peak flow below the pond to varying degrees. Overall watershed peak flows were decreased by 2%; however, some ponds reduced sub-watershed peak flow by 70 -100%. Decreasing peak flow may help to decrease stream power, which may help to maintain



channel stability while decreasing sediment loads (Goff and Gentry 2006).",Morris Pond,1990,Goodwin Creek watershed,lake,tp,54% for total phosphorus to 71% for nitratenitrogen,359.0595397949219,15.804723739624023,mg/L,

Nutrient removal with bottom sediment


Bottom sediment was removed from the LA, MA, and UA reservoirs and the B17 pond in volumes of 3040 m 3 , 2840 m 3 , 3548 m 3 and 367 m 3 , respectively. One cubic meter of fresh sediment corresponded to approximately 843 kg of sediment dry weight. The concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorous removed with these sediments ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 g for N and from 19.2 to 29.5 mg for P per kilogram of dry weight (Table 5). The highest amounts, 6407 kg N and 61.5 kg P, were removed with the sediment from LA. Although the sediment volume removed from UA was 15% higher than that the sediment removed from LA, the amount of the removed nutrients was lower -only 2991 kg N and 57.4 kg P were eliminated. The highest amount of phosphorous, 70.6 kg P, was removed with the sediment from MA (Table 1).



The removal cost for bottom sediments exceeded €80000. No further maintenance costs were associated with this action. Usually, for a 10-year period, the sediments should be removed again, which at least doubles the costs for a long-term perspective (Table 1).",MA reservoir,,,lake,tp,None.5,80.81607818603516,3.760365009307861,mg/L,

Vegetation harvesting from the shoreline zones and floating island


In 2015, we identified 3714 plants in the three vegetated shorelines planted at LA and B17 in 2013, and at MA in 2014. The autumn harvesting of vegetation from the shoreline vegetation zones removed over 2.5 kg of nitrogen and almost 0.5 kg of phosphorous (Table 1). Approximately 1000 plants were planted on the floating island, an area of 100 m 2 , which was constructed in LA in 2013. In all, 0.38 kg of N and 0.06 kg of P was estimated to have been removed from the floating island. The cost of construction and maintenance of the shoreline vegetation was €11250 from a 10-year perspective and is estimating to €15250 from a 20-year perspective (Table 1).




 
## 3.3.4. Hydrodictyon reticulatum removal


In 2014, H. reticulatum was removed from 450 m 2 and 1530 m 2 areas in LA and MA, respectively. The removal of H. reticulatum from LA and MA eliminated 18.5 g and 1.18 g of nitrogen and phosphorous, respectively, for each kilogram of dry biomass of these green algae (Table 5). In total, by removing 59.4 m 3 of algae, 11.6 kg of nitrogen and 0.74 kg of phosphorous were extracted from the reservoirs (Table 1). The cost of the one-time removal of H. reticulatum was €764.

The autumn harvesting of vegetation from the shoreline vegetation zones removed over 2.5 kg of nitrogen and almost 0.5 kg of phosphorous (Table 1). Approximately 1000 plants were planted on the floating island, an area of 100 m 2 , which was constructed in LA in 2013. In all, 0.38 kg of N and 0.06 kg of P was estimated to have been removed from the floating island. The cost of construction and maintenance of the shoreline vegetation was €11250 from a 10-year perspective and is estimating to €15250 from a 20-year perspective (Table 1).




 
## 3.3.4. Hydrodictyon reticulatum removal


In 2014, H. reticulatum was removed from 450 m 2 and 1530 m 2 areas in LA and MA, respectively. The removal of H. reticulatum from LA and MA eliminated 18.5 g and 1.18 g of nitrogen and phosphorous, respectively, for each kilogram of dry biomass of these green algae (Table 5). In total, by removing 59.4 m 3 of algae, 11.6 kg of nitrogen and 0.74 kg of phosphorous were extracted from the reservoirs (Table 1). The cost of the one-time removal of H. reticulatum was €764.

Removal of nutrients with sediment


Before restoration efforts, the bottom sediments from the Arturówek reservoirs were removed in 2000 by the Łódź City Government. The sediment thickness in UA in 2013, when it was dredged again, reached up to 40 cm and 3548 m 3 . In total, 9795 m 3 of bottom sediment was dredged from three reservoirs and B17 pond. The recommended period before the next dredging would be 10 years for this case. But we estimate that limiting the inflow of pollutants through the construction of SSBS and hybrid systems and other activities will extend this time to 20 years.



A literature review shows that the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous in bottom sediment is highly variable. In the Arturówek reservoirs, the amounts ranged from 1.0 to 2.5 g for TN and from 19.2 to 29.5 mg for TP per each kilogram of dry weight (Table 5). Studies conducted by Waajen et al. (2014) on three reservoirs, Dongen Pond (2500 m 2 ), Eindhoven Pond (6500 m 2 ) and Heesch Pond (1600 m 2 ) in the Netherlands, indicated that sediment contained 0.26 mg, 0.43 mg and 0.11 mg of phosphorous in one gram of dry weight, respectively. These values were 10 times higher than those of the sediment removed from the Arturówek reservoirs (0.024 mg P g -1 dry weight) and almost equivalent to those of sediment removed from the separators (0.435 mg P g -1 dry weight). This finding indicates in our case that the separator-removed sediment was a rich source of phosphorous and proves the efficiency of the separators as a part of the purifying systems (Jurczak et al., 2018a).",Eindhoven Pond,2014,Netherlands,pond,tp,0.43,85.94633483886719,3.705615758895874,mg/L,

concordance of species composition patterns among microcrustaceans; rotifers and testate amoebae in a shallow pond,bini et al.,2007,490,"## 2. Methods



 
## 2.1. Study Area


The samples were gathered in Samambaia Lake (16¡35 ′ S, 49¡16 ′ W), which is a 33 years old pond, with an area of ca. 4 ha. Approximately, 10% of this area is covered by submerged aquatic plants (mainly Lindernia sp.). The average depth is about 3 m, with a maximum depth of 4.5 m. Since this pond is located inside the campus of the Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil), it is relatively protected from sewage drains and other impacts (BRANDÃO and KRAVCHENKO, 1997). Total P, nitrate  and  nitrate  concentrations  ranged  from  1  to  160 µ g/L,  0.99  to  710 µ g/L and 9 to 100.5 µ g/L, respectively, with median concentrations of 33 µ g/L, 83.9 µ g/L and 44.2 µ g/L (NOGUEIRA, 1999).




 
## 2.2. Sampling


Samples were gathered on August 2003 (dry period) and January 2004 (rainy period), on nine sites distributed along the major axis of the pond (Fig. 1). On each site, 1000 L of water were filtered over a 70 µ m zooplankton net, using a suction pump. Samples were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and concentrated to a standard volume of 500 mL.



Testate  amoebae,  microcrustaceans  and  rotifers  were  counted  in  a  Sedgwick-Rafter  counting  cell using a stereomicroscope and were expressed as individuals per liter.



The following abiotic variables were determined with a HORIBA U - 10 water quality meter: pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity and water temperature. Water transparency (Secchi disk) and depth values were also recorded in all sites.",Samambaia Lake,,"Federal University of Goiás (State of Goiás, Central Brazil)",pond,tp,33,42.10750961303711,1.9154505729675293,µg/L,
conservation of pond systems: a case study of intractability; brown moss; uk,chaichana; ratcha; leah; rick; moss; brian,2011,523,"Nutrient concentrations of all study pools were generally very high with average SRP concentrations, l g l -1 (overall mean values of SRP 444 l g l -1 , TP 624 l g l -1 , ammonium nitrogen 1,104 l g l -1 , nitrate nitrogen 0.02 mg l -1 , TN 3 mg l -1 ). Concentrations of ammonium nitrogen ranged from 66 to 3,680 l g l -1 , nitrate from 0.03 to 2.03 mg l -1 and TN from 2.4 to 6.4 mg l -1 . Winter and summer values of nutrients in each pool are given in Table 3. Phosphorus tended to increase markedly in summer and nitrate to decrease. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 14 to 140 l g l -1 . Bray-Curtis analysis of nutrients (TP and TN) showed that the study pools at Brown Moss can be divided into three groups. The first group (pools 3 and 4) had relatively low nutrient concentrations compared with other pools. Close similarities among pools 6, 7, 10, 11and14werefound,withthesepoolsinasecondgroup with high concentrations of nutrients. The last group is composed of pools 1, 2 and 12 with waters that had very high concentrations of nutrients.



All pools were hypereutrophic (with TP values greater than 100 l g l -1 and TN values greater than 1,500 l g l -1 ). TN:TP ratios also suggested that pools 1, 2, 7, 10 and 12 were nitrogen limited with TN:TP ratios by mass lower than 10.

constructed treatment wetlands provide habitat for zooplankton communities in agricultural peat lake catchments,eivers; rebecca s.; duggan; ian c.; hamilton; david p.; quinn; john m.,2018,570,"## Habitat characteristics


Each habitat type supported significantly different zooplankton communities (refer to results of PERMANOV A and pairwise comparisons), including between drains and CTWs. Habitat morphologies including surface area, water depth and macrophyte cover were most strongly associated with variations in zooplankton composition, whilst significant water quality parameters included pH, conductivity, iron flocculant and concentrations of PO4-P and inorganic-N. Drain habitats were smaller and shallower than CTWs, with dense macrophyte cover, high concentrations of NH4-N and NO3-N, and high frequency of iron flocculant occurrence. CTW habitats were intermediate in size between lakes and drains, relatively deep and with high Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations, indicative of elevated phytoplankton biomass. Levels of PO4-P were also highest in CTWs, particularly in those with low pH. Lakes were naturally the largest habitats and moderately deep with warmer water temperatures, high DO and neutral pH. Similar to CTW habitats, lakes had elevated Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations due to high phytoplankton densities, which in turn supported greater zooplankton abundances.



As evidenced by the results from this study, dense macrophyte cover in small, shallow watercourses suppresses phytoplankton growth and can cause stagnant, reducing conditions, elevating NH4-N levels. Nonetheless, while excessive macrophyte growth can have negative impacts on stream



communities (Collier et al. 1999), macrophytes improve the structural complexity of freshwater habitats and strongly influence community structure and diversity (Warfe and Barmuta 2006; Lucena-Moya and Duggan 2011).",CTWs,,,wetland,tp,NoneWs,57.88333511352539,2.776569604873657,mg/L,

The ponds studied showed contrasting ecology spanning over a number of environmental gradients. TP



concentrations ranged from \ 50 l gP l -1 to [ 1 mgP l -1 ; DIN concentrations from below detection (1 l gN l -1 ) to [ 3 mgN l -1 ; pH from 7.1 to 9.7. Submerged vegetation cover varied from absence through sparse and patchy to dense and extensive, at times covering the whole surface of a pond (Table 1). Some ponds were fishless, whereas others harboured more than 1,000 kg ha -1 of plankti-benthivorous fish (data not shown). Because of the differences in submerged vegetation cover and fish biomass and community structure, zooplankton composition, of bloom per node and percentage of blooms accounted by node. The predictor variables and respective thresholds identified by the trees link the nodes. Dashed line outlines the optimal tree denoted by the 10-fold cross-validation procedure



densities and size were also very variable ranging from Rotifera to large-bodied Cladocera dominated communities.



Contrasting ecology was reflected on phytoplankton biomass and composition. Chl a concentrations covered the range from oligotrophic to hypereutrophic state (from \ 2 to [ 800 l g l -1 ; UNEP-IETC, 1999). The ponds with low phytoplankton biomass were generally dominated by cryptophytes, diatoms and chrysophytes, whereas the ponds with higher biomass tended towards chlorophyte, euglenophyte",ponds,,,pond,chla,2 to [800,121.92911529541016,4.6449151039123535,µg/L,

Effect of restoration measures on the chlorophyll a and microcystin concentrations


Urban impoundments may enrich municipal recreational offers and provide unique entertainment opportunities. However, low water quality and degraded hydromorphological characteristics may also limit these functions.

Concentrations of ammonium nitrogen ranged from 66 to 3,680 l g l -1 , nitrate from 0.03 to 2.03 mg l -1 and TN from 2.4 to 6.4 mg l -1 . Winter and summer values of nutrients in each pool are given in Table 3. Phosphorus tended to increase markedly in summer and nitrate to decrease. Chlorophyll a concentrations ranged from 14 to 140 l g l -1 . Bray-Curtis analysis of nutrients (TP and TN) showed that the study pools at Brown Moss can be divided into three groups. The first group (pools 3 and 4) had relatively low nutrient concentrations compared with other pools. Close similarities among pools 6, 7, 10, 11and14werefound,withthesepoolsinasecondgroup with high concentrations of nutrients. The last group is composed of pools 1, 2 and 12 with waters that had very high concentrations of nutrients.



All pools were hypereutrophic (with TP values greater than 100 l g l -1 and TN values greater than 1,500 l g l -1 ). TN:TP ratios also suggested that pools 1, 2, 7, 10 and 12 were nitrogen limited with TN:TP ratios by mass lower than 10. In contrast, phosphorus could have been limiting in pool 4 where the TN:TP ratio was greater than 17.

The contrasts among these ponds were in size (6 vs. 3 and 14), presence of fish (14 vs. 3 and 6), and position and surrounding land use (6 central, 3 and 14 marginal to the site). Concentrations of SRP and TP in pools 3, 6 and 14 showed similar trends in that they were relatively low in winter and tended to increase in spring and were highest in summer (Table 3, Fig. 4). In contrast, NO3 --N concentrations of all pools increased in winter and were lower in other seasons. In particular in pool 14, concentrations of NO3 --N increased dramatically in winter and the highest concentration detected in January was 2.9 mg l -1 . NH4 ? -N values were highest in pool 6 and were lower in pools 3 and 14 (Table 2).



Chlorophyll a concentrations of pools 3 and 6 were high in winter and low in summer (Fig. 5). In contrast, in pool 14, concentrations of chlorophyll a tended to increase from winters towards summer. Statistical analysis indicated that concentrations of chlorophyll a in pool 3 significantly differed from those in pools 6 and 14 ( P 3,6 = 0.017 and P 3,14 = 0.004).

Each habitat type supported significantly different zooplankton communities (refer to results of PERMANOV A and pairwise comparisons), including between drains and CTWs. Habitat morphologies including surface area, water depth and macrophyte cover were most strongly associated with variations in zooplankton composition, whilst significant water quality parameters included pH, conductivity, iron flocculant and concentrations of PO4-P and inorganic-N. Drain habitats were smaller and shallower than CTWs, with dense macrophyte cover, high concentrations of NH4-N and NO3-N, and high frequency of iron flocculant occurrence. CTW habitats were intermediate in size between lakes and drains, relatively deep and with high Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations, indicative of elevated phytoplankton biomass. Levels of PO4-P were also highest in CTWs, particularly in those with low pH. Lakes were naturally the largest habitats and moderately deep with warmer water temperatures, high DO and neutral pH. Similar to CTW habitats, lakes had elevated Chl a , Org-N and VSS concentrations due to high phytoplankton densities, which in turn supported greater zooplankton abundances.



As evidenced by the results from this study, dense macrophyte cover in small, shallow watercourses suppresses phytoplankton growth and can cause stagnant, reducing conditions, elevating NH4-N levels. Nonetheless, while excessive macrophyte growth can have negative impacts on stream
